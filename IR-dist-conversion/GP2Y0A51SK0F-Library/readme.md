# This folder contains the conversion of the Arduino-GP2Y0A21YK-library into a working GP2Y0A51SK0F library for our purposes

## Current progress

Finished writing C++ and arduino code for calculating the distance with the GP2Y0A51SK0F. Needs to be tested on an actual Arduino board and a GP2Y0A51SK0F sensor.
Moving forward, we can brainstorm further functionalities and add onto the existing library.
